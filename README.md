# Histopathological-Image-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
Thesis project by Braulio Arredondo 



On this repository you can obtain the general ranked metrics of Colon, Lung and Breast histopathological image classification. Ranking contains almost 800 different aprroaches of deep learning and machine learning techniques combined. 




This document presents an study of digital pathology classification using and combining several techniques of machine learning and deep learning. This project is offered to obtain
the Master’s Degree of Science in Computer Science at Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios ´
Superiores de Monterrey. Cancer is one of the most important diseases and cause of death
around the world. One of the main complications of the disease is the prediction at high stage
or grade of cancer. Nowadays there are many different studies to obtain a correct diagnostic
on time. some of these studies still being the tissue biopsies. These samples are analysed by a
pathologist, which has to observe a whole image of high dimensions pixel by pixel to give a
diagnostic of cancer presence, stage and type, or types in some cases. This activity takes a lot
of time for experts, this because usually several samples are extracted from a single patient.
To make this process faster and easier, several model has been developed to digital pathology
classification. With these models, are, at least easier leave and discard many slides of patient
to confirm a diagnostic with the most relevant or complicated slide by the pathologist. The
inconvenient with these models is that almost all of they are based on deep learning, techniques that is well known by his great performance, but also by his high requirements like
graphic processor and RAM. In consequence we performed a complete analysis of several
convolution networks used of different ways to compare outcomes and efficiency. Also we
include other deep learning techniques like recurrent neural networks and machine learning.
Combined models of deep learning and machine learning are presented as a possible alternative of convolution networks, this include 5 handcrafted features. The main objective of our
project is to present a real alternative capable to achieve similar outcomes than deep learning
with less resources. The experiments were successfully, including a real alternative for deep
learning and areas under the curve bigger than 90% for cancer of colon, lung and breast at
different magnifications.
